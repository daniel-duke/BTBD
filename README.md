# BTBD (Block-Tether Brownian Dynamics)

Inputs: design file, which specifies the geometry of the rigid bodies, the construction of origamis from these rigid bodies, and the linkers that connect origamis.

Output: geometry and input files for running the simulation in LAMMPS.

See the main script (BTBD.m) for a detailed description of the code, including how to construct design files and adjust simulation parameters.
